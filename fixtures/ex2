Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git reposi- tory will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during Deepthoughtâ€™s grading, the evaluation will stop END.
